# README

## Script Descriptions

- `train.py` - Train and cross validate a CNN to classify handwritten characters.

- `test.py` - Test pre-trained CNN.

## Running code

**Important Information**: The code was written in python 3.6.7 using PyTorch
library version 0.4.1.

To classify the 'a and b' dataset, run:

```
python test.py abData.npy out
```

where `abData.npy` can be a different name.

To classify the 'hard' dataset with 8 letters and unknowns, specify the `-e` flag:

```
python test.py hardData.npy out -e
```

To verify that our `train.py` script works, simply run:

```
python train.py
```

This uses the training data set we last trained the CNN on. The script may take
a while to run since it will run for at least 150 epochs. **IMPORTATN** The
script will overwrite files when it executes.
